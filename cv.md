### __Basic info__
I've always been interested in computer science and now that I'm adult I'd like to finaly follow this desire of mine.
Having been teaching English for many years I've realized how important the language is when it comes to learning, especially learning programming. Knowing the language helps me a lot since there're so many decent courses and videos in English. I love the process of coding and finding solutions. My enthusiasm, willing to learn new things and hopefully theoretical knowledge will help make my lack of experience a temporary thing.

### __Skills__

+ [x] javascript 
+ [x] html

Here is a short code example:
```javascript

    const form = document.createElement('form');
    form.setAttribute('method', 'post');
    rootDiv.appendChild(form);
    let signList = document.createElement('select');
    signList.setAttribute('id', 'select');
    form.appendChild(signList);
    signs.map( (elem, i) => {
        let newOption = document.createElement('option');
        newOption.setAttribute('value', elem);
        newOption.innerText = signDates[i];
        signList.appendChild(newOption);
    });
```

### __Work experience__
My coding experience includes:
1. Adding markup and script to websites 
1. Creating online-shops using Wordpress, JavaScript and PHP
1. Making simple games and webpages as a part of my self-education.

I have been making websites with the help of Wordpress CMS for a couple of years (online shops mostly). I also was a part-time system administrator in a Minsk Gestalt Institute for 2 years.

Here are some examples (the code of each one can be seen in code example part above):
- [Horoscope game](https://lenayork.github.io/horoscope/)
- [Learn English words game](https://lenayork.github.io/Cubs/)
- [Caller ID](https://lenayork.github.io/Caller-ID/)
- [Clock](https://lenayork.github.io/Clock/)
